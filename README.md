# frontendDEV_OC_2023_prechallenge
my project for the html project
this is a study-project in order to learn and understand web-dev basics and bachground information about web development
Code within this project files appears to be imperfect and a base for my case-study, code is -if copied from other sources - marked as such
In case something is missing, inform me instead of biting - cheers a fellow JR frontendDev 2be
