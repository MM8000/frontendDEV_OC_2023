				<p>Nowaday's - AI may be able to (re)craft a lot of fine digital artwork by <abbr title="Immersive & AI based">Stable-Diffusion </abbr>- a digital neural network.
					But we also must see the beautiful source of it, which is fine digital 2D and 3D art made by humans.</p>

				<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
				<p>Lays withing the creativity that one has to find and seek for oneself. Art enlightenment was driven aside and merely suppressed in most "adults" life due to the pressure of "society" or a set of rules that one thougt one's life had to contain, but somehow became contained by.</p>
				<p>We must clear the mind of the past. Creativity is fun and we should definately invite more fun into our lifes e.g <a href="https://www.sdmfoundation.org/2022/07/20/how-to-have-fun-with-digital-art-using-procreate/" title="SDMfoundation article">How to have fun with digital art.</a> 
					In case your curiosity is still on fire being detained by the rules in your head -<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAXtO5dMqEI&ab_channel=PabloPARRADO" title="Matrix scene">There is no spoon.</a></p>
				<p><em>Artn3twork</em><br>invites you to relax and inhale on the important lessons of life. B-yourself. Begin to see with clarity. Learn to use your creativity and the techniques will come to you naturally.

				<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
				<p>There is a continuing need for digital-design people e.g <abbr title="Game-, Web- and Art-Developers">"DEVs"</abbr>. Artn3twork aims to amaze, excite, inspire, and encourage people and therefor participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. 
					Clicking on any one will load a different example of how digital art may be expressed.</p>
				<p><abbr title="Hyperlinks">Web-Anchor-Tags</abbr> allow travelling within the blink of an eye to gather information from every corner of the globe. Use them wisely. A piece of advice for the raod ahead: try making one step after another. Finding one's crativity back after years and years is like travelling a road less taken.</p>
				<blockquote class="blockquote" id="bquote" cite="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/44272/the-road-not-taken">
					"... I shall be telling this with a sigh<br>Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br>I took the one less traveled by,<br>And that has made all the difference."</blockquote><p>The road not taken <strong>by Robert Frost</strong></p>

				<h3>"Participation" in yourself</h3>
				<p>Strong visual design has always been our focus. By modifying a sketch, a strong <abbr title="Graphics Design skills and abilities">GD skill-set</abbr> is necessary too, but the example-links on our websita are commented well enough that even <abbr title="Graphics Design skills and abilities">GD skill-set</abbr> beginners can make use of the points presented. Please see the <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/rRXk2E" title="League of Legend Game Design Study">"Farewell" case study"</a> for advanced works of digital sketching.</p>

				<h3>Benefits</h3>
				<p>Why participate in yourself? For recognition, inspiration, and resources we can all refer to learned skills, and - on the other hand -  really soon can be a skill- and helpful member of the art community. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on designs today, learning tools for those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.</p>

				<h3>Requirements</h3>
				<p><em>"Every once in a while, a major technological breakthrough transforms the way we go about our personal or professional lives.</em> For those who draw, sketch, paint, or create visual art, the <a href=https://www.skillshare.com/en/blog/procreate-101-everything-you-need-to-know-to-get-started/ title="You installed Procreate on your iPad, but you’re not sure what to do with it.">iPad Procreate app</a> has been one such game changer. Designed to be used with Apple’s tablet and stylus tools, Procreate gives artists all the benefits of working digitally while recreating the familiar experience of pens, pencils, and paint on paper." Skillshare</p>
				<p><strong>Game development from the perspective of a hobbyist.</strong> "You don't need to spend the time, effort, and money on large programs designed for professional game designers if all you're trying to accomplish is to have a minimum viable product at first.
					For <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNaQqfM9QaE" title="Vid: Importance of Game Design & Creating Game Art With Procreate.">JohnDav</a>, procreate was the answer. A simple tool with some powerful features like the ability to layer images, tons of awesome creative brushes, and the ability to create color pallets from images or live on the spot through the camera of the iPad. 
					The best feature of Procreate though is that the iPad is such a game changer when it comes to portability. Being able to work on game assets on the go whenever creativity sparks in one's brain has since been a real benefit."</p>
